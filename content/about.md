I'm Riyon Aryono. I build things for the web, tinker with data, and obsess over minimal systems. When not compiling something, I'm likely at a gig, reading, or finding good ice cream.

**Current interests:**
- Open source & Linux
- Music & Reading
- Making sense of the chaos

## Colophon

This website is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast and flexible static site generator. The design is intentionally minimal and text-focused.

The structure draws heavy inspiration from [Anders](https://anders.unix.se/), whose clean and thoughtful approach to personal websites reminded me why I fell in love with the web.
