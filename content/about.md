## Who I Am

I'm Riyon Aryono, a software engineer and Computer Science student based in Indonesia. I build things for the web and occasionally write about whatever random thigs are in my head. 

By day, I'm buried in code and coursework. By night, I'm usually playing guitar, going to gigs, or wandering around finding ice cream. I write to process random thoughts and dissect ideas. Often, these notes turn into real projects later.

### What I Do

I work primarily with web technologies building applications, APIs, and everything in between. I'm passionate about clean code, good design, and making software that doesn't suck.

Current interests:
- Open source & Linux
- Music & Reading
- Making sense of the chaos

## Colophon

This website is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast and flexible static site generator. The design is intentionally minimal and text-focused.

The design and structure of this site draws heavy inspiration from [Anders](https://anders.unix.se/), whose clean and thoughtful approach to personal websites reminded me why I fell in love with the web.
