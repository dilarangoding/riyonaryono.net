### Currently

I like making things. It helps me learn. I enjoy building systems and figuring out how to keep the human connection within the logic.

I’m a Computer Science student by day. By night, I’m usually playing guitar, going to gigs, or wandering around finding ice cream. I write to process random thoughts and dissect ideas. Often, these notes turn into real projects later.
